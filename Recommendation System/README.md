# Usage 

1. Prepare the dataset by downloading it from Kaggle and placing it in the designated data directory.

2. Run the recommendation system.

3. Explore the recommendations and enjoy personalized movie suggestions.

# Collaborative Filtering
The collaborative filtering technique is implemented to analyze user behavior and preferences. It identifies patterns by comparing user interactions with movies and recommends items based on similarities with other users.

To use collaborative filtering, set the collaborative_filtering parameter to True in the recommend_movies.py script.

# Content-Based Filtering
Content-based filtering relies on the characteristics of movies and users' preferences. It recommends items similar to those the user has liked in the past, considering features such as genre, director, and actors.

To use content-based filtering, set the collaborative_filtering parameter to False in the recommend_movies.py script.
